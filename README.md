# QMR
This is the code of the paper "QMR: Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks".  We use the WSNet simulator which can be uploaded via https://github.com/CEA-Leti/wsnet.
To run our code, you first need to upload the WSNet simulator via the above URL.
Detailed simulation configuration parameters are shown in  "qmr.xml".
The implement of our routing protocols is shown in "qmr.c"
