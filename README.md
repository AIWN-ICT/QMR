# QMR
This is the source code of the paper titled "QMR: Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks".  
To run our code, you first need to download the WSNet simulator via https://github.com/CEA-Leti/wsnet.
Detailed simulation configuration parameters are shown in  "qmr.xml".
The implement of our routing protocols is shown in "qmr.c.
